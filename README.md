# steam-market-bot
Discord bot mainly using Java and Selenium to scrape price, wear, and other data of CS:GO skins on the Steam Marketplace with use of the [CSGOFloat API](https://github.com/csgofloat/inspect).
If you plan on heavily using this bot, please host the CSGOFloat Inspect Link Repo linked above.

As of right now, I have little to no idea what I am doing but the code should work with some tinkering.
